There are two branches of openFoam: ESI-OpenCFD [openfoam.com](https://www.openfoam.com/) and OpenFOAM-9 [openfoam.org](https://openfoam.org/).
Please follow the instructions for the branch you choose. I recommend you install both branches.

There are several ways to install openFoam (use instructions from openfoam.* pages to decide which is best for you):
	- natively (pre-compiled or not)
	- through Docker (by making a container)
	- by Windows Subsystem

From my personal experience, 
	- if using Mac OS X, use openFoam on Docker Desktop
	- if using Windows, install WSL and subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu)
	- if using Ubuntu, Linux, you have it easy
	
For post-processing, it is best to install native [paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)


OpenFoam Installation Tips & Notes & Troubleshooting for Systems
	Mac
	  - openFoam container in docker does not come with text editor or paraview 
	  - so, use two terminal windows--one to use nano or vim (text editor) and the other to run openFoam
	  - you will have to run a .sh script to set up docker, find explicit instructions [here](https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/run-shell-sh-script-on-macos/)
